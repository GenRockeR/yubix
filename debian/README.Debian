== YubiX

NOTE: This project is deprecated and is no longer being maintained.

=== Description
YubiX is a stack of software that works together, letting you build your custom
solution ontop of it. It consists of many of Yubico's software offerings, but
also some third party software, such as FreeRADIUS. YubiX is available as a 
Debian package, easily installable under a Debian based OS, and as a virtual 
appliance that's ready to go right out of the box.

=== Core features
 * YubiAuth, the extensible user authentication framework capable of utilizing
   YubiKeys as well as a YubiHSM for increased security.
 * RADIUS authentication of users, with optional YubiKey support.
 * Capable of using the YubiCloud validation service, or a self-hosted server.
 * Web-based administration for simple setup and administration.
 * Modular composition, allowing you to pick and choose among which services to
   use, and the freedom to provide parts of your own.

=== What's Included
Among the things included in YubiX is the YubiAuth user authentication backend,
which keeps a database of users and lets them authenticate using a password
and/or YubiKey. FreeRADIUS is also installed, and configured to use the
YubiAuth backend for user authentication, giving you RADIUS support with the
YubiKey from the start. You can also use YubiAuth for user authentication in
your own custom software.

The default configuration uses our free YubiCloud service for YubiKey OTP
validation, which works with the pre-programmed YubiKeys we sell immediately.
You can instead opt to run your own validation servers, and re-program YubiKeys
for those servers, and YubiX comes with the validation and KSM server software
required to do so.

Managing YubiX can either be done by manually editing configuration files, or
by using the included YubiAdmin administrative web interface. By default, this
interface can be accessed by pointing a web browser to the IP of the YubiX 
installation. The first time you do this, you will be asked to set a username
and password to prevent unauthorized access.
